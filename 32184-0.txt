THE LION'S MASQUERADE.                                             [p 3]


  As Aurora stept forth from the gates of the East,
  With her garland of roses, and dew-spangled vest,
  A clamour unusual assaulted her ear,
  Instead of the Lark, and her friend Chanticleer,
  At least though their voices she sometimes could trace,
  They seem'd overpower'd by the whole feather'd race:
  And such was the chirping, and fluttering then,
  It rouz'd _an old Lion_ asleep in his den;
  Enrag'd at this racket so much out of season,                    [p 4]
  He, roaring, sent out to ask what was the reason,
  And the _Jackal_ soon learnt from some stragglers about,
  'Twas the company come from _Sir Argus's_ rout.
  The gay _feather'd people_ pursuing their flight,
  Were soon out of hearing, and soon out of sight.
  But the _King of the Quadrupeds_ vainly sought rest,
  For something like envy had poison'd his breast.
  What then were his feelings the following day,
  When every creature he met on his way,
  Could talk about nothing, both early and late,
  But the Peacock's most sumptuous, and elegant fête.
  His name, through the woods as he wander'd along,
  Was still made the burthen of every song.
  That the concert was exquisite, all were agreed,                 [p 5]
  And so were the ball, and the supper indeed,
  The company too of the very first rank,
  And the wit that prevail'd, and the toasts that were drank:
  He found to his infinite rage and vexation,
  'Twas the favourite subject half over the nation;
  And feeling no longer a relish to roam,
  He return'd to his Lioness, sullenly, home.
  "Fair consort of mine, 'tis our pleasure," he said,
  "To give very shortly, _a grand Masquerade_.
  Tho' the Butterfly's ball, and the Grasshopper's feasts,
  Were too mean for my notice, as King of the beasts;
  Now the Peacock has chosen to give a fine rout,
  Which is heard of so much, is so blazon'd about,
  Has excited such rapture, and warm approbation,                  [p 6]
  As threatens the rank which we hold in creation.
  Then with diligence, love, for my banquet prepare,
  And mind all the beasts of the forest are there."
  'Twas the task of the _Jackal_ the tickets to pen,
  "_The Lion sees masks, on the twentieth, at ten_."
  It would take a whole volume distinctly to name,
  The answer on answer that following came.
  There were some that were sick from the changeable weather,
  And some long engag'd in snug parties together.
  But few, very few would refuse such a thing,
  As a grand entertainment announc'd by their King.
  All devoted the time now to due preparation,
  To decide on their character, dress, decoration.

[Illustration: _"The Lioness, willing to sanction the rest." p. 7._]

  At length Phoebus dawn'd on the long wish'd-for day              [p 7]
  Which their beauty, their talents, and wit should display.
  What licking, and cleaning, what endless adorning,
  Not a creature stirr'd out the whole course of the morning;
  And some of their dresses were barely complete,
  At the time they were punctually order'd to meet,
  The _Lioness_, willing to sanction the rest,
  With a helmet, and spear, as Britannia was drest;
  But the Lion, as lord of the banquet, remain'd
  In the same noble figure that Nature ordain'd;
  And crouching beside her, with dignified mien,
  Contributed much to the state of his Queen.
  The _Jackal Lord Chamberlain_ waited upon her,
  And two _little Lap-dogs_ as _Pages of Honour:_
  While twelve _Orang-Outangs_ were station'd without,             [p 8]
  To usher the company in, and about.
  At the hour which his King had thought proper to name,
  The _Horse_, as the _Hounyhm_ of Gulliver came;
  Unaccustomed to "utter the thing that is not,"[*]
  He reach'd, at the moment he promis'd, the spot.
  The _Fox_ then appear'd on a different scent,
  On foul depredation, and villainy bent;
  And the dress of a _country attorney_ he chose,
  To his purpose best suited, as all the world knows!
  With looks as impatient, and teeming with sin,
  The _Wolf in Sheep's-clothing_ was next usher'd in.


    * Vide Gulliver's Travels.

[Illustration: _"A Lamb Miss in her teens, with her Aunt, an old Mutton."
                                                                   p. 9._]

  The guests now came thronging in numbers untold,                 [p 9]
  The furious, the gentle, the young and the old.
  In dominos some, but in characters most,
  And now a brave warrior, and then a fair toast.
  The _Baboon_, as a _Counsellor_; _Alderman_, _Glutton_;
  A _Lamb_, Miss _in her teens_, with her _aunt_, an _old mutton_.
  It was easy to see, as this couple past by,
  The _Wolf_, very knowingly, cast a _Sheep's eye_.
  And now at the door was a terrible clatter,
  The beasts all about wonder'd what was the matter.
  A poor _Cat in pattens_ came running so fast,
  Her ticket was almost forgot as the past;
  But there was, it appear'd, quite enough to alarm her,          [p 10]
  For close at her heels came a _great Hog in armour_.
  Then follow'd his friend in a very large wig
  As a _deep read professor_--the _fam'd learned Pig_--
  A _Bear_ came as _Caliban_, loaded with wood,
  His bones full of _aches_ from Prospero's rod.
  The _Greyhound_ as _Vanity_ holding a glass,
  The _Stag_, as _Actæon_; King _Midas_, the _Ass_.
  And next them a sullen, and obstinate _Mule_,
  As a _Dunce_, who had just been expell'd from his school.
  The _Mastiff_ a brave _English sailor_ appear'd,
  No friend he betray'd, and no enemy fear'd:

[Illustration: _But there was it appear'd, quite enough to alarm her.
                                                              p. 10._]

  _Britannia_ receiv'd him with mark'd condescension,             [p 11]
  And paid him all night, most distinguished attention.
  Now skipping along on the tip of his toe,
  Came a _chattering Monkey_, a Frenchifi'd beau:
  And reeling behind, in an _officer's dress_,
  Was his pert younger brother, just come from the mess;
  With manners as forward, and strut as complete,
  As other _young Ensigns_ you see in the street.
  The _Bull_ came as _Taurus_, all studded with stars;
  _Capricornus_, the _Goat_; a _Bull-dog_, as Mars.
  Now refreshments by order were handed about,
  And the dancing commenc'd with a terrible rout;
  When suddenly silence pervaded the throng,                      [p 12]
  Some Eastern grandees were conducted along.
  Attendants preceded with all due decorum,
  And _Spaniels_, as _courtiers_, came fawning before 'em.
  No longer in servitude bending the knee,
  And destin'd, the first of his kind, to be free,
  The _Camel_ approach'd, with magnificence drest
  As a _Nabob_, who lately arriv'd from the East.
  From the Island of _Ceylon_ an _Elephant_ came,
  In costume complete, as the _King of Siam_:
  Thence follow'd a _Native_ of snowy white race,
  Respect and affection, were mark'd in his face,

[Illustration: _"Thence follow'd a Native of snowy white race." p. 12_]

  An appendage of grandeur, with chowries hung round,             [p 13]
  And tissu'd embroidery that trail'd on the ground;
  Round his tusks precious stones, gold, and diamonds were set,
  He was one splendid mass from his head to his feet.
  The _Tiger_, a _fierce Indian Chief_, in the rear,
  Many foreigners too of distinction were there.
  This magnificent group so astonish'd the crowd,
  That some, in their rapture, applauded aloud.
  Supper now was announc'd; with a terrible crush,
  To the door did the ravenous visitants rush:
  For some time none could pass, but the first that were able,
  Found, _Glutton_ the _Alderman_, seated at table.
  At the banquet the guests in amazement were lost,               [p 14]
  And the _King of Siam_ took the right of his host.
  Beside him, a vase fill'd with water was plac'd,
  Of chrystal, and gold, very skilfully chac'd:
  With flow'rs of the orange the handles were bound,
  And Otto of Roses was sprinkled around--
  Before him were cocoa nuts, figs, wheat, and rice,
  The wood of acacia, banana, and spice:
  With arrack, and every delicate wine,
  That each nation can press from the clustering vine.
  To proceed were but tedious; for every _beast_,
  As well as the _Elephant_, found a rich feast.

[Illustration: _"At the Banquet the guests in amazement were lost."
                                                             p. 14_]

  And now their _great Monarch_, who quitted his seat,            [p 15]
  With an air of true majesty said, "I entreat,
  As he fears my displeasure, that every _creature_,
  Will to-night lay aside all that's bad in his nature.
  You have heard with what harmony _Birds_ can retire,
  And their conduct in this respect all must admire.
  In the _feather'd race_ here an example we find,
  Far better than that which is set by _Mankind_.
  How oft have their galas a tragical end,
  One loses a mistress, another a friend--
  The wife of a third has elop'd from a ball,
  A fourth the next day in a duel must fall.
  Yes! such are the fatal effects of excess,                      [p 16]
  Which _reason_ was given to _man_ to repress.
  But now let us tell them, with pride, in their _feasts_,
  To copy the _Insects_, the _Birds_, and the _Beasts_."
  The effect of his speech was immediately seen,
  They all roar'd _"Rule Britannia"_ in praise of his Queen.
  And as soon as their _Monarch_ had quitted the room,
  Without growl, grunt, or grumble, they all scrambled home.


FINIS.
